# login_task

I developed a small Flutter project as part of a task for AIM Technologies Islamabad, focusing on implementing secure and efficient login functionality.

## Getting Started

This Flutter project integrates Firebase Authentication, providing a secure and user-friendly authentication system. Leveraging the Cubit state management pattern, the project enables users to sign in using email and password, with input validations ensuring that credentials are correctly formatted before the API call is made. This approach enhances the overall security and user experience by preventing errors during the login process.

A standout feature of this implementation is the automatic user registration. If a user attempts to log in but does not yet exist in Firebase, the app automatically registers the user with the provided credentials and then completes the login process. This functionality streamlines the user onboarding experience, making it easier for new users to access the app without needing a separate registration step.

Upon successful login, users are seamlessly navigated to a placeholder home screen, where they are greeted with a logout option. The logout functionality allows users to easily return to the login screen, ensuring smooth navigation and maintaining session security. This comprehensive setup combines secure authentication, user convenience, and efficient state management to deliver a polished user experience.
